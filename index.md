## Trailing Commas

This website is to support the use of trailing commas!

### Don't be a Peasant

Peasants don't understand how important commas are. Make sure you use them on every line.

### Why should I use trailing commas?
1. Clean diffs in code merges with less code changed. Also makes pull requests easy.
1. You don't have to add more commas when you add more code!
